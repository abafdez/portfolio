# Portfolio — project guide for Claude

Alfonso's personal portfolio, built as a **learning project** (Alfonso is a junior dev).

## How we work

- **Faster learning mode (since Phase 3).** Claude may write the code for each step, then explains the concepts behind it, with doc links.
- **Before moving to the next step, Claude interviews Alfonso** with 2–4 short questions on that step's concepts (the why, not trivia). If an answer is off, clarify and re-check before moving on.
- Keep the code small and in the project's style so Alfonso can read all of it. Point out anything worth trying by hand (small experiments in DevTools or the build output).
- One branch and one PR per phase. Write **one Bitácora entry per topic** (not one per phase), and copy each one to the Obsidian vault project `10 Projects/Portfolio/` (use the `obsidian-obsidianai` skill).
- Write **one `draft: true` blog article per topic** too (e.g. design tokens, cascade layers, dark mode), in `content/blog/`.
- The learning path (phases 0–9) is in [learning-path.md](learning-path.md). Check which phase is current before suggesting work.
- **Progress:** Phases 0–2 done (CI split, TypeScript, layout/routing/base path). **Next: Phase 3 (Open Props).** Update this line when a phase is merged. The latest `content/bitacora/` entry has the details.
- When the work changes something a `draft: true` post in `content/blog/` describes, update that post too. Leave `<!-- TODO -->` placeholders where Alfonso's own code goes rather than writing the solution into the post.

## Stack & decisions

- SvelteKit 3, Svelte 5 (runes forced), adapter-static, deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/`.
- Open Props for design tokens; mdsvex for markdown; migrating JS+JSDoc → **TypeScript** (Phase 1).
- **Planned: named themes** (Tokyo Night, Dracula…) **and user-generated themes**, both as overrides of our semantic tokens. So components and other CSS use semantic tokens only; color primitives live only in `src/lib/styles/tokens.css`.
- Package manager: `pnpm`. Checks: `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`.

## Folders

- `content/` — markdown sources, published from Phase 6 on:
  - `bitacora/` — short, dated dev-log entries (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`). Use the `bitacora-entry` skill.
  - `blog/` — long-form, polished articles.
  - `awesome/` — Awesome-X curated lists.
- `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/` — project-local skills and agents (committed).
- `static/` — files served as-is (robots.txt, etc.).
